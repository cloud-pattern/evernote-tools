little demo for if you import notes to evernote from a different note program and your note titles were messed up.

this will replace the title with the first line of the body of the note,
    then append the current title to the end of your note, 

for the first arg, give it a "p" for production, anything else for sandbox
       2nd and 3rd optional:
        , second arg is the notebook name
        ,third is a tag name

it shows you how to do both oauth or just using your dev token
    the oauth is kinda crazy cause you have to paste it into your browser for user approval
